SVG cross:
- image instead?
- fix slight difference in look when size scrolling between crossing

Blocks:
- don't trigger useEffect handleBlockClick when block is mounted
- multiple buttons being pressed at the same time

Layout: 
- hint pane x not properly aligned with grid
  - bit of extra padding on the bottom hint bar pushing everything up
